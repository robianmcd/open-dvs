Minimal Angular 2 Hello world app with a production ready build that uses Rollup and Gulp.

This project uses gulp v4 so if you have `gulp` installed globally you will need to uninstall it and replace it with `gulp-cli` which works with both gulp 3 and 4. e.g.

```bash
npm uninstall -g gulp
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Run the following to build and run the app:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
